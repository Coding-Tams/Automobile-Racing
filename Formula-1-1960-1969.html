  <p>Again the Moroccan Grand Prix was cancelled for monetary reasons.</p>
  <p>Wolfgang Von Trips died during the Italian Grand Prix.</p>
  <p>At the Monaco Grand Prix work teams and past winners were guaranteed grid places leaving nine drivers to qualify for the remaining four slots.
    The organisers of the Belgian Grand Prix invited 25 entries, but they were only going to pay starting money to 19 of the entries which were 16 pre selected cars plus the three fasteset of the remaining nine cars.
    Three of the cars without the starting money decided not to race. The top four classified cars were Ferrari's.
  </p>
  <p>The French Grand Prix was very hot with the track temperatur 50 degrees and the air temperature was 39 degree. Giancarlo Baghetti won on his Formula 1 debut, it was his only Formula 1 win.
    Giuseppe Farina is the only other driver to win their debut race.
  </p>
  <p>The British Grand Prix was the final race a rear engined car was entered, it was the last Formula 1 home race for Stirling Moss.</p>
  <p>The German Grand Prix was the 100th Formula 1 Grand Prix, Stirling Moss won the race, it was his last Formula 1 win and the last home race for Wolfgang Von Trips.
    Tony Maggs made his Formula 1 debute at the German Grand Prix, he was the first South African driver, Ferrari secured the constructors championship at the race.
  </p>
  <p>37 cars entered the Italian Grand Prix, a maximium of 32 could start the race. A rule was put in place enforcing a 115% cut off for qualifying, the 115% cut off time was against pole position.
    So to qualify drivers had to be within the 115% cut off time, Ricardo Rodriguez posted the fastest time of 2:46.4 so the cut off time was 3:11.36.
  </p>
  <p>At the end of lap 2 Wolfgang Von Trips lost control and crashed into a fence into a fenced line of spectators. The race was not stopped allegedly to avoid the spectators going home en masse jamming the roads around the stadium impeding the rescue work.
    Phil Hill won the drivers cahmpionship at the race.
  </p>
  <p>The Ferrari team again did not enter the United States Grand Prix. Roger Penske's car was painted bright Dupont Anti-Freeze yellow, the colour of his spoonsors, this was one of the first instances of commercial sponsorship in Formula 1.

      <h2>1967 Formula 1 Season</h2>
      <p><strong>Denny Hulme</strong> won the championship and <strong>Brabham</strong> won the constructors championship. Denny Hulme is the only New Zealander to win the World Championship.</p>
      <p>Denny Hulme became the first of two drivers to win the championship without scoring a pole position during the season. Niki Lauda is the only other driver to repeat theis feat.</p>
      <p>Pedro Rodriguez won the South African Grand Prix, it was his first Formula 1 win and the first win for a Mexican driver. The win was the last for the Cooper team.
        Piers Courage made his Formula 1 debut at the race which was the first Formula 1 race held at the Kyalami circuit.
      </p>
      <p>On lap 82 of the Monaco Grand PRix Lorenzo Bandini clipped the chicane, hit a hidden mooring and over turned. The car exploded into flames amongst the straw bales.
        Bandini was trapped under the car, the rescue operation was inadequate as minutes passed before the fire was extinguished and Bandini was rescued and rushed to hospital.
        The downdraught from the rotor blades of the low hovering helicopter fanned the embers of the fire which reignited. Straw bales were banned from future Formula 1 races, the development of fire-retardant fuel systems and flameproof clothing for drivers and marshals accelarated.
        Lorenzo Bandini died three days later.
      </p>
      <p>The Belgian Grand Prix was the only win for a USA built car and one of only two wins for an American-licenced constructor in Formula 1.
        American Dan Gurney won the race.
        Mike Parkes crashed on the first lap of the race, the car rolled and Parkes was thrown from the car. He was in a coma for a week and never raced in Formula 1 again.
      </p>
      <p>The French Grand Prix was the only time a Formula 1 race was held at the Bugatti circuit at Le Mans. The circuit was seen as boring and unpopular with the drivers and the crowd.</p>
      <p>Formula 2 cars took part in the German Grand Prix some of them had wooden chassis, Jackie Olivier was the highest classified Formula 2 driver, he finished fifth overall.
        11 cars were classified, three were Formula 2 cars.
