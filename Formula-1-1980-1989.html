<!--1981 Season-->
  <h2>1981 Formula 1 Season</h2>
  <p><strong>Nelson Piquet</strong> won the drivers title and <strong>Williams</strong> won the constructors title. </p>
  <p>Nelson Piquet won his first World Championship.</p>
  <p>The inagural Formula 1 World Championship replaced the World Championship of Drivers and the International cup for constructors. The teams were now required to lodge entries for the entire championship season, the FIA also set the prize money for all the races. 
    Alain Prost had moved from Mclaren to Renault, John Watson took Prost's place at Mclaren. Ligier had changed name to Talbot, Jean-Pierre Jarier took Jean-Pierre Jabouille's seat at Talbot. 
    Derek Daly moved to March from Tyrrell, Mario Andretti left Lotus for Alfa Romeo, Nigel Mansell replaced him at Lotus. The Tyrrell team were without sponsorship and the Arrows team had new sponsorship from Ceramiche Ragno and Beta. 
    Due to financial difficulties the United States Grand Prix was dropped, the South African Grand Prix was stripped of its championship status. The race went ahead under Formula Libre rules due to ongoing FISA-FOCA wars. 
    The FISA were the Federation Internationale du Sport Automobile, the FOCA were the Formula 1 Constructors Association.
  </p>
  <p>Most of the teams lodged a protest over the Lotus twin chassis that they debuted at the United States Grand Prix, the cars were allowed to take part in Friday practice but were banned from the rest of the weekend. 
    It was Riccardo Patrese's first Formula 1 pole and the only pole for the Arrows team. The Tyrrell team failed to qualify, it was the first time the team failed to qualify for a race. 
    American drivers Mario Andretti and Eddied Cheever finished in the points, it was the first time since 1975 that two American drivers had finished in the points. 
    Chico Serra was the only rookie to qualify for the United States Grand Prix.
  </p>
  <p>Formula 1 had moved to the Jacarepagua Circuit from the Interlagos Circuit for the Brazilian Grand Prix. Colombian Ricardo Londono was denied a superlicense so was not allowed to participate in the raceweekend. 
    Argentinian Carlos Reutemann won the race by ignoring pit signals to give up the lead to his team mate and the number one driver for the team, Alan Jones, who finished second but did not show up on the podium.
  </p>
  <p>The Argentinian Grand Prix was the last until 1995, Mclaren entered a car with a chassis made from carbon fibre composites. Alan Prost scored his first Formula 1 podium.</p>
  <p>Team Lotus withdrew from the San Marino Grand Prix because the FIA upheld the ban on the Lotus 88 with the Twin chassis. It was the first San Marino Grand Prix and the second Formula 1 race held at Imola. 
    The Toleman team made it's Formula 1 debut, Michele Alboreto made his Formula 1 debut at the race.
  </p>
  <p>At the Belgian Grand Prix Osella team mechanic Giovanni Amadeo stumbled off the pitwall into the path of Carlos Reutemann during Friday practice. Amadeo suffered a fractured skull and died from his injuries on the Monday after the race. 
    The mechanics staged a protest over safety before the start of the race and many drivers joined them. The race organisers flagged the warmup lap at the normal time leaving several cars on the grid, this resulted in chaos when the grid reformed at the end of the warm up lap. 
    Nelson Piquet missed his starting position and was sent round on another lap, the rest of the cars were held in position.<br/>
    The cars began to overrheat and several drivers turned their engines off expecting another formation lap due to Piquet's error, but the organisers began the start sequence once Piquet regained his position. 
    Riccardo Patrese was unable to restart his car and waved his arms to signal he could not start the car, his mechanic Dave Luckett came onto the track to restart the car from behind. 
    As he did so the clerk of the course had already started the lighting sequence to start the race despite the mechanics presence on the starting grid the race started. 
    Siegfried Stohr ploughed into the back of Patrese, hitting the mechanic Luckett who suffered a broken leg and lacerations, the race continued with Stohr's disabled car still on the track. 
    Some furious marshals jumped onto the track and frantically waved at the drivers to stop, the confused drivers waved back at the marshals but on the next lap the drivers stopped. 
    A new rule was introduced that forbade mechanics from being on the grid within 15 seconds of the formation lap and the race starters would use greater caution.<br/>
    The race was stopped on lap 55 of 70 due to rain.<br/> 
    Alan Jones crashed into the barriers and badly burnt his left thigh after the gearbox oil leaked into the cockpit. 
    It was the last Formula 1 win for Carlos Reutemann and the last Formula 1 win for an Argentinian driver. Nigel Mansell scored his first Formula 1 podium finish. 
  </p> 
  <p>Nine cars had to pre-qualify for the Monaco Grand Prix, the fastest four went into the main qualifying session. Slim Borgudd, Derek Daly, Eliseo Salazar, Brian Henton and Derek Warwick all failed to pre-qualify. 
    The start of the race was delayed due to a fire at the Hotel Kitchens, water had seeped into the tunnel. Gilles Villenuve won the race, it was his first win since 1979, he became the first and only Canadian to win the Monaco Grand Prix and the only driver from North America to win a Monaco Grand Prix.
  </p>
  <p>The John Player Special sponsorship livery returned to Team Lotus at the Spanish Grand Prix. The race was the last Spanish Grand Prix held at Jarama and the last Spanish Grand Prix until 1986. 
    Gilles Villenuve won the race, it was his final Formula 1 win. Eliseo Salszar had left the March team to join Ensign to replace Marc Surer.
  </p>
  <p>Alain Prost's first Formula 1 win came at the French Grand Prix driving for French team Renault. The race was stopped after 58 laps due to heavy rain, it was later restarted, aggregate times determined the final positions. 
    Jean-Pierre Jabouille retired from Formula 1 before the race, he had not fully recovered from the injuries he had sustained at the 1980 Canadian Grand Prix. 
    Patrick Tambay moved from Theodore Racing to Ligier to replace Jabouille.

    <!--1982 Season-->
    <h2>1982 Formula 1 Season</h2>
    <p><strong>Keke Rosberg</strong> won the drivers World Championship and <strong>Ferrari</strong> won the Constructors Championship.</p>
    <p>Keke Rosberg only won 1 race during the season, 11 different drivers from 7 different teams won a race during the season. No driver won more than twice, with nine different winners in nine consecutive races from Monaco Grand Prix to the Swiss Grand Prix. 
       </p>
    <p>The Argentine Grand Prix was cancelled due to a lack of sponsors and the Spanish Grand Prix was omitted. The Detroit and Swiss Grand Prix were added to the calendar, the United States hosted three Grand Prix during the season, it was the only time a country held three races until 2020.</p>
    <p>Alan Jones and Carlos Reutemann had retired from Formula 1 at the end of the 1981 season, but Reutemann returned for two races during the 1982 season. 
      Keke Rosberg replaced Alan Jones at Williams and Niki Lauda returned to Formula 1 after a two year absence. 
      Marc Surer was meant to drive for the Arrows team but he broke both feet in a pre-season test, Patrick Tambay replaced Surer but was fired after taking part in the drivers strike and the seat was eventually filled by Brian Henton.
    </p>
    <p>34 cars were permitted to enter races with 24 cars starting the race, so pre-qualifying was introduced in which the three teams who finished at the bottom of the standings and new teams had to pre-qualify for races. 
    </p>
    <p>Before the beginning of the season the drivers had recieved a letter from the FISA containing an application form for their new super licence. The document stated that the drivers would not be allowed to switch team freely during the season, with their licence being withdrawn should they do so. 
      Six drivers refused to sign the document, the drivers who had not signed were excluded from practice at the South African Grand Prix.
    </p>
    <p>Carlos Reutemann scored his final podium finish at the South African Grand Prix, it was the final Formula 1 podium fininsh for an Argentinian driver.</p>
    <p>Nelson Piquet crossed the finish line first at the Brazilian Grand Prix and Keke Rosberg crossed in second place. but both were disqualified after their cars were found to be underweight. As a result the FOCA teams boycotted the Sn Marino Grand Prix. 
      Alain Prost was the winner of the race and John Watson finished second and Nigel Mansell third. Many of the drivers suffered from exhaustion due to the intensely hot weather. Carlos Reutemann retired from Formula 1 after the race.
    </p>
    <p>Williams called on Mario Andretti for the United States Grand Prix to replace the retired Carlos Reutemann. 
      The San Marino Grand Prix was boycotted by many teams, only seven teams took part giving a field of just 14 cars. After Nelson Piquet and Keke Rosberg were excluded from the Brazilian Grand Prix due to underweight cars, the FOCA protested and boycotted the race. 
      The FOCA aligned teams that did not boycott the race were Tyrrell, Osella, ATS and Toleman, they cited sponsor obligtions. They joined the FISA aligned Ferrari, Renault and Alfa Romeo for the race.
    </p>
    <p>Gilles Villenuve was killed during qualifying for the Belgian Grand Prix. Jochen Mass was travelling slowly, he saw Villenuve approaching at high speed and moved to the right to let him through on the racing line. 
      At the same instant Villenuve moved right to pass Mass, Gilles Villenuve launched into the air at 200-225 km/h after hitting Mass. He was airbourne for over 100m before nose diving into the ground and disintegrating as it somersaulted along the edge of the track. 
      Villenuve was thrown out into the catch fencing. The first doctor arrived on the scene within 35 seconds to find Villenuve not breathing, he was transported to hospital and diagnosed with a fractured neck and died that evening. 
      Ferrari withdrew from the race.
    </p>
    <p>Eddie Cheever scored his first Formula 1 podium finish at the Belgian Grand Prix, the Fittipaldi team scored their last Formula 1 points.</p>
    <p>Ferrari entered only one car for the Monaco Grand Prix, Didier Pironi. Riccardo Patrese won the race, it was his first Formula 1 win. </p>
    <p>The Detroit Grand Prix was hels on a temporary Street Circuit.</p>
    <p>The Canadian Grand Prix had moved to the summer rather than being held in the autumn. Riccardo Paletti died during his second Formula 1 race, Didier Pironi had stalled on the grid, he signalled he had a problem just as the lights switched to green, it was too late to abort the start. 
      Raul Boesel clipped the back of Pironi spinning into the path of Eliseo Salazar and Jochen Mass, Riccardo Paletti could not react in time and slammed into Patrese at 180km/h catapulting him into path of Geoff Lees. 
      Paletti sustained heavy chest injuries, as the doctor tried to rescue Paletti the fuel tank ignited, Paletti did not have a pulse when the fire was extinguished. He was flown to hospital but died soon after arriving in hospital
    </p>
    <p>Patrick Tambay replaced the late Gilles Villenuve at Ferrari from the Dutch Grand Prix, Didier Pironi won the race, it was his final Formula 1 win.</p>
    <p>Jochen Mass immediately retired from Formula 1 after the French Grand Prix, on lap 11 of the race Mass and Mauro Baldi collided. Mass's car went through the catch fencing into the tyre walls and was catapulted into the spectaor area and the car caught fire. 
      Didier Pironi was seriously injured during qualifying for the German Grand Prix, but he did manage to secure pole position, he never raced in Formual 1 again. 
      Pironi was too injured to start the race and Ferrari did not replace him so pole position was left empty for the start of the race.
    </p>
    <p>Nelson Piquet became the first driver in modern Formula 1 to make a planned pit stop when he pitted mid-race during the Austrian Grand Prix, he pitted for fuel and change of tyres. 
      Elio de Angelis won the race, the last win for Lotus until 1985.
    </p>
    <p>Keke Rosberg's only win of the season came at the Swiss Grand Prix, it was his first Forumla one win and the first for a Finnish driver. 
      The race was the first Swiss Grand Prix since 1954 and also the last.
    </p>
    <p>Mario Andretti finished third at the Italian Grand Prix, he also scored pole position for the race. It was his last pole, podium and points in Formula 1. 
      Rene Arnoux announced he would be replacing Andretti at Ferrari.
    </p>
    <p>Tyrrell's first Formula 1 win since 1978 came at the Caesars Palace Grand Prix, Michele Alboreto won the race, he was the 11th different driver to win a race during the season, Tyrrell was the 7th different winning constructor during the season. 
      Keke Rosberg secured the drivers title and Ferrari won the constructors title at the Caesars Palace Grand Prix. 
      It was the last Formula 1 race held in Las Vegas, Ensign and the Fittipaldi teams left Formula 1 and Matra left Formula 1 as an engine supplier and it was the last Formula 1 race for the March team  until 1987. 
      The Caesars Palace Grand Prix was the third Formula 1 race held in the United States during the season.
    </p>
