    <h2>1973 Formula 1 Season</h2>
    <div class="shadow">
    <p><strong>Jackie Stewart</strong> won the drivers championship, <strong>John Player Team Lotus</strong> won the constructors championship.</p>
    <p>Two new Grand Prix were introduced, the Brazilian Grand Prix at Interlagos and the Swedish Grand Prix at Anderstorp.
      At the Canadian Grand Prix the safety car was used for the first time and the warm-up lap was introduced where the cars did a full warm-up lap before the race.
      A numbering system for teams was formalised in Brazil, team mates were paired up in the numbering. The Lotus team were assigned numbers 1 and 2, Tyrrell were given 3 and 4 etc, the numbers assigned were changed at the Belgian Grand Prix when the order was set for the rest of the season.
      For the 1974 season the numbers were assigned based on the 1973 final standings. 
    </p>
    <p>Francois Cevert dided during the United States GRand Prix practice, Jackie Stewart and the Tyrrell team withdrew from the race. Roger Williamson was killed during the Dutch Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Ronnie Peterson won his first Formula 1 pole position at the Brazilian Grand Prix. During the South African Grand Prix Mike Hailwood pulled Clay Regazzoni from his burning car after the two collided onlap 2.
      Hailwood's driving suit caught fire, after being extinguished by a fire marshal he returned to help Regazzoni. Hailwood was later awarded the George Medal.
    </p>
    <p>The Zolder track had to be resurfaced a week before the Belgian Grand Prix as the drivers had inspected the track and found it had started to break up.
      The Monaco circuit had been heavily revised, the Gasworks hairpin replaced Rascasse and Antony Naghes corners. The pits were moved back to the start-finish straight on a wide pit lane.
      Jackie Stewart equalled the 25 Formula 1 wins record set by Jim CLark when he won the Monaco Grand Prix, James Hunt made his Formula 1 debut at the race.
    </p>
    <p>Ronnie Peterson won the French Grand Prix, it was his first Formula 1 win. Rikky Von Opel made his Formula 1 debut at the race, he is the only Formula 1 driver from Liechtenstein.
      Opel is the great grandson of Adam Opel, the founder of the German car maker Opel.
    </p>
    <p>The British Grand Prix was the only Formula 1 race with four drivers from New Zealand taking part, the drivers were Denny Hulme, Chris Amon, Howden Ganley and Graham McRae.
      On the first lap there was a pile up, 11 cars retired from the race. Jody Scheckter spun across the track at woodcote causing the pile up.
      Andrea de Adamich suffered a broken ankle which ended his Formula 1 career, the race was stopped at the end of lap 2 and restarted with 18 cars.
    </p>
    <p>James Hunt scored his first Formula 1 podium finish at the Dutch Grand Prix, Jackie Stewart won the race becoming the most successful driver with 26 wins.
      On lap 8 Roger Williamson hit the barrier at speed, he was catapulted 275m across the barriers on the other side. The petrol tank ignited and the car caught fire, Williamson had not been seriously injured but was trapped in the car.
      David Purley stopped on the opposite side of the track and ran across the live track to assist Williamson. Purley tried to upright the car but was unable to do so by himself, the marshals were not wearing flame retardant overalls and were unable to help.
      Race control assumed Purley's car had crashed and the driver had escaped, the race continued at full pace.
      There was only a single fire extinguisher in the area which was not enough to put the fire out, a marshal led a distraught Purley away when the situation became helpless.
      Some spectators tried to breach the safety fences to try to help but were pushed back by security, it took eight minutes for the fire engines to completely travel around the track.
      Roger Williamson had died of asphyxiation by the time the car was finally uprighted, a blanket was thrown over the burnt out wreck with Williamson still inside, the race carried on. David Purley was awarded the George medal for bravery.
    </p>
    <p>On lap 2 of the German Grand Prix Niki Lauda broke his wrist in a crash. The March team did not participate in the race following Roger Williamson death.
      Ferrari, Ensign, Tecno and Hesketh did not participate in the race, Mclaren, Brabham and Surtees entered three cars each.
    </p>
    <p>Jackie Stewart scored his final podium finish at the Austrian Grand Prix, Carlos Pace scored his first Formula 1 podium finish.
      Niki Lauda was forced to miss his home Grand Prix after breaking his wrist during the previous race, the BRM team did not replace him.
    </p>
    <p>Jacki Stewart secured the championship at the Italian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Peter Revson won the Canadian GRand Prix, it was Jackie Stewart's Formula 1 race.
      The race started in very wet conditions, Francois Cevert and Jody Scheckter collided on lap 32 and the safety car was deployed for the first time in Formula 1.
      The small pit lane became very busy, many drivers had to drive throught as there was no room for them. This caused confusion as some believed Howden Ganley wass in the lead and others believed Emerson Fittipaldi was.
      Emerson Fittipaldi was not show the chequred flag, instead the flag was waved over a group of cars consisting of Howden Ganley, Mike Hailwood, Peter Revson and James Hunt.
      Ganley did not believe he had won the race but the officials announced Peter Revson as the race winner.
    </p>
    <p>Francois Cevert died during practice for the United States Grand Prix, he crashed in the uphill esses, he ran too high on the kerbs, slid into the right hand guardrail.
      The car lashed sideways across the track at 150mph at almost 90 degrees, the nose submarined into the ground, the car flipped upwards and over the barriers coming to rest upside down ontop of the Armco barrier and Cevert died instantly.
      The Tyrrell team withdrew from the race.
    </p>
    <p>Team Lotus won the constructors title at the United States Grand Prix.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Female driver Lella Lombardi made her Formula 1 debut at the British Grand Prix, her race number was #208 because she was sponsored by Radio Luxembourg and 208 was the stations frequency.</p>

    <h2>1977 Formula 1 Season</h2>
    <div class="shadow">
    <p><strong>Niki Lauda</strong> won the drivers championship and <strong>Ferrari</strong> won the constructors championship.</p>
    <p>The calendar expanded to 17 races, the German ATS team took over the Penske cars and Renault enterd Formula 1. 
      The BRM team qualified for the South African GRand Prix, it was the last time the team ever qualified for a Formula 1 race.
    </p>
    <p>Wolf Racing made their Formula 1 debut at the Argentine Grand Prix which was the final podium finish for Carlos Pace.</p>
    <p>The South African Grand Prix was a tragic race, on lap 22 of the race Rezo Zarzi pullled off the circuit to the left side of the straight just after the brow of the hill and the bridge over the track.
      He was having problems with the fuel metering unit which was pumping fuel directly into the engine which caught fire.
      Zorzi could not disconnect the oxygen pipe from the helmet so couls not get out. The Oxygen pipes were used to prevent drivers being suffocated if they were trapped in a car in a fire. 
      Two marshals from the pit wall on the opposite side of the track intervened, the first marshal, 25 year old William managed to cross the track.
      Second marshal 19 year old Frederik Jansen Van Vuuren was carrying a fire extinguisher and did not make it across the track in time. 
      Hans-Joachim Stuck and Tom Pryce came over the brow of the rise in the track, Stuck saw Jansen Van Vuuren and moved to the right to avoid the marshals.
      Pryce could not see the marshall and unable to react in time he struck Jansen Van Vuuren at 270km/h who was thrown into the air and landed in front of Zorzi and died on impact.
      The fire extinguisher Jansen Van Vuuren was carrying hit Pryce's head before striking the roll hoop, it bounced over the grandstand and alnded in the car park to the rear of the stand and hit a car.
      The impact of the extinguisher had wrenched Pryce's helmet upwards sharply and death was almost instantaneous, his car continued down the main straight at speed towards the first corner.
     The car left the track to the right scraping metal barriers hitting the entrance for emergency vehicles, the car veered back onto the track, it then hit Jacques Laffite's car sending both cars head on into the barriers. 
    </p>
    <p>Mario Andretti was the first American driver to win a Formula 1 race on home soil when he won the United States Grand Prix West. Lotus debuted their ground-effect car. 
      Alan Jones was signed as the replacement for Tom Pryce and Hans-Joachim Stuck replaced Carlos Pace who had died in an aircraft accident less then two weeks after the South African Grand Prix.
      Stuck was meant to driver for ATS but went to Brabham instead, ATS signed Jean-Pierre Jarier instead.
    </p>
    <p>At the Spanish Grand Prix 31 cars entered the race but only 25 cars could start the race, six drivers failed to qualify for the race. 
      Riccardo Patrese made his Formula 1 debut at the Monaco Grand Prix.
    </p>
    <p>There were two Swedish driver on the podium at the Belgian Grand Prix, it was the only time it happened. Gunnar Nilsson won the race, it was his only Formula 1 win, Ronnie Peterson finished third. </p>
    <p>Jacques Laffite became the first French driver to win a Formula 1 race in a French car of a French team when he won the Swedish Grand Prix. </p>
    <P>The British Grand Prix was the last race to be given the honoury title of the European Grand Prix, all following European Grand Prix were title of races rather than an honory title of a race. 
      Gilles Villenuve made his Formula 1 debut at the race and qualified for the race finishing 11th in the race. 
      40 cars entered the British Grand Prix, it was the largest number of entrants meaning fourteen cars had to pre-qualify. The fastest five drivers from sessions 1 and 2 went into the full qualifying session. 
    </P>
    <p>The German Grand Prix moved to Hockenheimring again, Hans Heyer participated in the race despite not qualifying, but a maechanical issue forced him to retire from the race on lap 9. 
      This caused his participation to be discovered and he was disqualified, and became the only driver to not qualify, not finish and be disqualified in a single race.
    </p>
    <p>Ferrari won the constructors title at the Italian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Alan Jones' first Formula 1 win was at the Austrian GRand Prix, it was the only Formula 1 win for the shadow team. 
      Niki Lauda won the drivers championship at the United States Grand Prix, he quit Ferrari after the race as he had announced his intention to moc=ve to Brabham for 1978.
    </p>
    <p>During practice for the Canadian Grand Prix Ian Ashley was seriously injured when his car hit a bump, flipped, vaulted the barrier and crashed into the television tower, the crash ended his Formula 1 career. 
      Later Jochen Mass crashed into a barrier that flatterned upon inpact, he was uninjured and finished the race in third place, it was his final Formula 1 podium. 
      The Canadian Grand Prix was the only race Ferrari failed to win during the season, Jody Scheckter won the race, it was the last race won by a non-European constructor until 2006. 
      It was the last time a Formula 1 race was held at Mosport Park.
    </p>
    <p>The Japanese Grand Prix was the last to be held at Fuji Speedway until 2007 and the last Japanese Grand Prix until 1987. 
      A marshal and photographer were killed by debris following a collision involving Gilles Villenuve and Ronnie Peterson on lap 5, the marshal and photographer had been standing in a prohibited area of the track. 
      After the race concluded James Hunt and Carlos Reutemann left the circuit immediately to catch flights home. Hunt had finished first and Reutemann had finished second, so there was just Patrick Depailler and his engineer on the podium. 
     Rules were changed making it mandatory to attend podium celebrations. 
     Ian Scheckter was expelled from Japan due to only having a tourist visa in his passport and he needed a working visa. 
     Riccardo Patrese scored his first points in Formula 1, it was the final Formula 1 win for James Hunt. Team Lotus had a red livery for the race promoting the parent company Imperial Tobacco instead of their usual John Player special livery.
