    <h2>The First Automobile Race.</h2>
    <div class="shadow">
    <p><strong>22 July 1894, Paris, France.</strong></p>
    <p>The first ever automobile race took place on 22 July 1894, it started in Paris and finished in Rouen.</p>
    <p>The race was <em>Concours du 'Petit Journal' les voitures sans chevaux</em> (Le Petit Journal horseless carriage contest. 
    102 cars were entered for the 126km / 78 mile race, only 21 cars qualified for the race as 78 cars did not arrive.
  In the lead up to the race there were 8 50km qualifying events.</p>
  <p>Entries included cars powered by gravity, petrol, steam, hydraulic air compressor, oil, serpollet steam, liquid, electric and propeller.
    For qualifying vehicles were put into groups to ensure there were different vehicles in each group. In each group there was a petrol vehicle, a steam vehicle, a Peugeot and a Panhard and Levassor.
  The groups set off from Parte Maillot on 19 July 1894, the second qualifying event was on the 20th July and the third was on the 21st.</p>
  <p>On the 22nd the race started at 8am at Parte Maillot, the cars set off at 15 seccond intervals with the first leaving at 8am. 
    The first driver to cross the fininsh line was Jules Albert, Count de Dion, second over the line was Albert Lemaiture. 
  Count de Dion crossed the line in 6 hours 48 minutes at an average speed of 19km/h / 12mph in his steam powered De Dion tractor, Albert Lemaiture arrived 3 minutes 30 seconds behind Count de Dion.
Lemaiture was in a petrol powered Peugeot. Comte de Dion did not win the race as his tractor needed a stoker, Albert Lemaiture won as his petrol powered Peugeot didn't need an extra person to run.
Auguste Doriot finished third in a vis a vis (face to face) Peugeot, the last across the line was Ernest Archdeacon in a serpollet steam powered vehicle. He croosed the line in 17th place, he had taken 13 hours to complete the race, the last petrol powered car across the line was a Benz driven by Emile Roger, he completed the race in 10 hours 1 minute and was in 14th place. </p>
</div>

<h2>1895 Season</h2>
<div class="shadow">
<p>Three races took place, the Torino - Asti - Torino in Italy, the Paris - Bordeaux - Paris in France and Chicago Times - Herald Race in America.</p>
 <p>There were 30 entrants for the Paris race, 21 qualified for the race and 9 cars finished the race. It was a 1178km race over 48 hour and was offically for four seater cars.
   Emile Levassor crossed the line first six hours before Louis Rigoulat and 11 hours before the offical winner Paul Koechlin. 
   Levassor and Rigoulat both drove two seater cars, Koechlin was the first four seater car to cross the line. Amedee Bollee was the last car across the line within the time limit.
   The cars taking part were either steam or petrol powered.
</p>
<p>The Chicago Times - Herald race was the first race held in America, the race was announced on the 10 July 1895. 
  The first automobile in America had only been produced two years earlier, horse and carriage was still the main mode of transport. 
</p>
<p>The original course for the Chicago race was to run from Chicago north to Milwaukee, but the roads were too poor for the cars. 
  The route was changed to 54 miles/ 87km from Chicago to Evanston and back, it was intended to be held on 2 November but only a few cars had shown up and the race was rescheduled.
  83 cars had submitted entries for the race but only six cars arrived in Chicago, Elwood Haynes and the driver of a Benz car were stopped by the police while they  were driving into the city.
  The drivers were forced to acquire horses to pull the cars as they had no right to drive their vehicles on the city streets, this caused the race to be postphoned again.
  The editors of the Chicago Times - Herald had to convince the city leaders to pass an ordinance to confirm the right of the vehicles to travel on the city streets.
  On the 28 November the race was finally held, the weather had turned snowy and it was 4 degrees, the roads were with snow drifts in places. 
  Four cars and two motorbikes took part in the race, there were three Benz cars and Frank Duryea's motorised wagon.
  An electric powered vehicle took part but did not get far before the battery died due to the cold weather, one Benz struck a horse just after the start and was forced to retire.
</p>
<p>Frank Duryea won the Chicago Times race in his Duryea car, he finished the race in 10 hours 23 minutes, at an average speed of 7mph/ 11km/h.
  Charles Brady King had to take over the driving of the Benz of Oscar B Mueller who became unconcious from exposure. King was originally an umpire for the race.
</p>
<p>After the race in Chicago the commercial production of American automobiles began the following year.</p>

<h2>1903 Season</h2>
<div class="shadow">
  <p>The Paris to Madrid Race was meant to be the first major race in Spain. The race started in front of Eau des Suisses at the garden of Versailles, the cars started the race at 1 minute intervals. 
    It took almost three hours for all the cars to leave the start line. Soldiers were deployed to manage the crowds but were insufficient, the roads were covered in dust so the first kilometre of road was watered down. 
    The visibility dropped to just a few metres and the crowd was becoming a persitant danger as some wandered into the road. 
    Many cars crashed into trees and disintegrated, some turned over and caught fire and some of the cars axles broke. All the drivers were exhausted and the dust made their eyes sore and many burnt their hands while trying to fix their engines. 
    Camille du Gant was the second female driver to take part in an automobile race.
  </p>
  <p>Marcel Renault crashed during the race and died 48 hours later, there were other fatal accidents during the race including mechanics and spectators. Many of the cars had crashed or retired during the race. 
    12 people were presumed dead and 100 wounded, the actual count was lower, only 8 people had died.
  </p>
  <p>The race paused in Bordeaux, the cars were transported to Spain where the race was meant to continue from the Spanish border to Madrid. 
    The Spanish government denied permission for the race to go ahead and the race was declared over finishing in Bordeaux. 
    The cars were impounded and towed to Madrid railway station for them to be transported back to Paris.

<h2>1906 Season</h2>
<div class="shadow">
  <p>Regarded as the first Grand Prix racing season.</p>
  <p>The first French Grand Prix was held, it was the first ever automotive Grand Prix race. Hungarian driver Ferenc Szisz won the race, the first Hungarian driver to win a race and the first ever driver to win a Grand Prix race.</p>
  <p>Conte Vincenza Florio devised the Targa Florio, which was run on unsealed mountain roads of Sicily amd the race was three laps of 150km circuit. 
    The cars had to cost less than 20,000 French Francs and at least ten have had to have been built.
  </p>
  <p>Vincenzo Lancia founded his own car company at the end of the year, he had been a FIAT works driver.</p>
  <p>The first French Grand Prix was held at Le Mans on closed public roads, it was 12 hours long and the circuit was 66 miles/ 106km of primarily dust roads sealed with tar. 
    12 manufacturers entered nine were French, two were Italian and there was a Mercedes from Germany, most of the team entered three cars. 
    The exhaust pipes were directed upwards to limit the dust kicked up, the hot conditions melted the newly laid tar road surface which broke up. 
    Roads closed to the public at 5am on the morning of the race, a draw took place to determine the starting order. Two lines of cars formed behind the start line and the cars left at 90 second intervals beginning at 6am. 
    The last of the 32 starters was Clement-Bayard, he started the race at 6.49am. 
    The circuit formed a triangle through farmland and forests, most tracks were trianglar at the time.
  </p>
  <p>The race started outside Montfort and headed south-west towards Le Mans, the Fourche hairpin turned sharply left and the cars slowed to 31 mph. 
    Then the straight road through Boulaire, south-east towards Saint-Calais which was bypassed with a temporary wooden plank road track which headed north and followed a plank road through the forest bypassing most of the town of Vibraye. 
    It then headed north to the outskirts of La Ferte-Bernard, the last leg of the triangle. 
  </p>
  <p>The time set on the first day of the Grand Prix determined the time the drivers set off on day two, Ferencz Szisz had a time of five hours and 45 minutes, meaning he started at 5.45am, horses turned the competitors out of parc ferme. 
    As the day grew hotter the tar began to melt which was kicked up by the cars, the tar which was kicked up seeped passed the goggles inflaming the eyes. 
    11 of the 32 starters finished the race, Hungarian Ferencz Szisz won the race in 12 hours and 14 minutes in a Renault. 
    Michelin, Dunlop and Continental supplied tyres for the race, Michelin introduced the junte amovible, a detachable rim with the tyre already affixed, it could be quickly fitted in the event of a puncture which were common. 
    Changing a tyre involved slicing off the old tyre with a knife and forcing the new tyre onto the rim, this took 15 minutes. 
    Michelin's new rim took less than 4 minutes, only one driver and riding mechanic were allowed to work on the car during the race. Szisz need 19 tyre changes during the race.
  </p>
  <p>Grand Prix refered to the prize for the race winner.</p>

<h2>1909 Season</h2>
<div class="shadow">
  <p>Renault had withdrawn from motor racing and a number of French manufacturers followed, this caused the French Grand Prix to be cancelled.</p>
  <p>Emphasis shifted to endurance and speed records, Benz & Cie built the Blitzen Benz, it held the land speed record from 1909 until 1922. 
    For the few events that were held for larger cars Formula Libre (free formula) was used.
  </p>
  <p>A 2.5 mile track was statted to be built at Indianapolis in the United States, the first race was held on 19 August. The track was a surface of crushed gravel and asphalt, it broke up during the race and was the cause of several crashes, five people were killed. 
    3.2 million bricks were used to pave the track before the 1910 season earning the nickname, 'The Brickyard'. 
  </p>
  <p>The Vanderbilt Cup opened up to allow product cars, this removed the interest of European manufacturers and the race became a national event.</p>
