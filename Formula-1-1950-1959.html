  <p><strong>Giuseppe Farina</strong> won the championship.</p>
  <p>First season of the FIA World Championship of Drivers, the Indianapolis 500 was classed as part of the championship but none of the regular Formula 1 drivers or teams took part.
    Out of the 14 teams that took part in the championship four were works teams.</p>

    Nine of the drivers were from the UK, the Ferrari team did not take part.
  </p>
  <p>There was a large pile up on the first lap of the Monaco Grand Prix due to a wave from the harbour flooding the track at Tabac corner. Louis Chiron finished third in the race, the only driver from Monaco to score points in Formula 1 until Charles Leclerc in 2018.
    The last race of the season was the Italian Grand Prix, Juan Manuel Fangio, Luigi Fagioli and Giuseppe Farina went into the race with a chance of winning the championship.
    Giuseppe Farina won his home race and won the championship becoming the first Formula 1 World Champion and the only driver to win the championship on home soil.

  <h2>1951 Formula 1 Season</h2>
  <div class="shadow">
  <p><strong> Juan Manuel Fangio</strong>  won the championship.</p>
  <p>Strling Moss made his Formula 1 debut at the Swiss Grand Prix.</p>
  <p>53 year old Luigi Fagioli became the oldest driver to win a race when he won the French Grand Prix, he shared his car and win with Juan Manuel Fangio.
    It was Fagioli's first win and it was the first time that two drivers were credited with a Formula 1 win after sharing a car. Luigi Fagioli was ordered to swap cars with Juan Manuel Fangio when  Fangio's car was misfiring.
    After the race Fagioli quit Formula 1 as he was furious that he had to had over his car to his team mate. During the race Jose Froilan Gonzalez had to hand his car the Alberto Ascari when Ascari's gear box broke.
  </p>
  <p>Jose Froilan Gonzalez won the British Grand Prix in an old chassis, his team mate had a newer chassis.
    It was also Ferrari's first Formula 1 win and pole position, it was the first pole in Formula 1 not held by an Alfa Romeo and first race not won by an Alfa Romeo.
    British team BRM arrived late to the race and had not practiced or qualified, they started 19th and 20th but were soon chasing the race leaders.
  </p>
  <p>Alberto Ascari's first Formula 1 win came at the German Grand Prix.
    Jean Behra secretly replaced Maurice Trintigant at the Italian Grand Prix due to Trintigant being ill. The team principal Amedee Gordini did not inform the race organisers about the switch as it would have cut the teams starting fee.
    Felice Bonetto and Giuseppe Farina finished third at the Italian Grand Prix due to sharing a car, Bonetto handed his car over to Farina on lap 29.
  </p>
  <p>The German and Spanish Grand Prix were new races added to the Formula 1 calendar. Juan Maneul Fangio, Alberto Ascari and Jose Froilan Gonzalez went into the Spanish Grand Prix battling for the title. 
    Juan Manuel Fangio won the race and Jose Froilan Gonzalez finished second, Fangio won the championship.

    <h2>1954 Formula 1 Season</h2>
    <div class="shadow">
    <p><strong>Juan Manuel Fangio</strong> won the championship.</p>
    <p>The Dutch Grand Prix was originally scheduled to be held at Zandvoort, but the circuit had financial troubles so the race was cancelled. 
      Alberto Ascari had left Ferrari for the newly formed Lancia team. It took the whole season for the Lancia cars to be ready, the team managed to have them ready for the final race of the season.
      Juan Manuel Fnagio moved to Mercedes, a new works team. The team was returning to Grand Prix racing, they had a streamlined single seater with closed wheel body.
    </p>
    <p>Juan Manuel Fangio won the Argentine Grand Prix, his first home win. Pole position was won by 47 year old Giuseppe Farina who became the oldest driver to score a pole position.
      He finished second in the race, his 17th podium finish.
    </p>
    <p>Stirling Moss first podium finish came at the Belgian Grand prix. During the race Roberto Mieres car caught fire, he managed to get out of the car with only minor burns.
      Emmanuel de Graffenried car was used to film authentic race footage for the film The Racers. </p>
      <p>Mercedes made their debut at the French Grand Prix, Germn driver Karl Kling made his Formula 1 debut with Mercedes. Juan Manuel Fangio had moved to Mercedes and he won the race.
        Karl King finished on the podium on his debut and was the first German driver to finish on the podium.
        Mercedes were the first German team to win a Formula 1 race and the first non Italian constructor to win a race.
      </p>
      <p>The Vanwall team made their formula 1 debut at the British Grand Prix, Ron Flockhart and Horace Gould made their debuts as well.</p>
      <p>The German Grand Prix lasted 3 hours 45 minutes, it was the longest Formula 1 race until the 2011 Canadian Grand Prix.
        Argentinian driver Onofre Marimon died during practice at the German Grand Prix. He failed to negotiate a corner and plunged down an embankment, the car somersaulted and Marimon was killed instantly.
        It was the first driver fatality at a Formula 1 weekend, team mate Luigi Villoresi withdrew from the race.
      </p>
      <p>The Swiss Grand Prix was the last motor race held in Switzerland. After the 1955 Le Mans disaster the Swiss government banned all forms of motor racing in the country.
        The ban was lifted in 2015, but only for electric vehicles. The Spanish Grand Prix was the last Formula 1 race held at the Pedralbes Street Circuit.
        The Lancia cars were finally ready in time for the Spanish Grand Prix.

      <div class="shadow">
      <p><strong>Juan Manuel Fangio</strong> won the championship.</p>
      <p> Mercedes dominated the season but they left the championship at the end of the season. They didn't return to Formula 1 until 1994 when they entered as an engine supplier and in 2010 they returned as a constructor.
        Mercedes left Formula 1 after the manufacturer was involved in a fatal disaster at the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. 
        After the Le Mans diaster the French, German, Spanish and Swiss Grand Prix were cancelled. Motor racing was banned in Switzerland and the Pedralbes and Bremgarten circuits were abandoned and never used again.
      </p>
      <p>The Argentine Grand Prix was the hottest Formula 1 race ever held with temperatures of 40 degrees centigrade. The very hot and dry weather was very taxing for the drivers and cars.
        Only two drivers completed the full race without handing the car to another driver, Argentinians Juan Manuel Fangio and Roberto Mieres.
        During the race there were 16 driver substitutions. Juan Manuel Fangio suffered severe burns to his legs which was rubbing against the chassis frame which was being heated by the exhaust.
      </p>
      <p>Maurice Trintigant won the Monaco Grand Prix, it was his first Formula 1 win and he was the first French driver to win a Formula 1 race. 
        Alberto Ascari crashed through the barriers into the Monaco harbour and had to swim back to safety. Louis was the oldest driver to start a Grand Prix at 55.
        The race was Ascari's last Formula 1 race, he died four days later during a test at Monza for Ferrari. He died on the 26th May 1955, his father had died during the French Grand Prix on 26th July 1925.
      </p>
      <p>The Lancia team with drrew from Formula 1 after Alberto Ascari's death.</p>
      <p>Stirling Moss won the British Grand Prix, he was the first British driver to win the British Grand Prix. Jack Brabham made his Formula 1 debut at the race.</p>
      <p>Juan Manuel Fangio won the Italian Grand Prix in a Mercedes, it was the last race for Mercedes as a constructor until 2010.
        It was the last Formula 1 race for the first Formual 1 World Champion Giuseppe Farina.

      <div class="shadow">
      <p><strong>Juan Manuel Fangio</strong> won the Championship.</p>
      <p>Juan Manuel Fangio won his fourth consecutive title and his fifth in total, this record was not beaten until 2003 by Micheal Schumacher. 
        Fangio moved to Maserati and Stirling Moss moved to Vanwall, they were the only drivers who won races during the season. 
        Ferrari failed to win a race during the season both Ferrari driver Eugenio Castelloti and Alfonso de Portago were killed in crashes during the season, neither was during Formula 1 races. 
        Castelloti was killed during testing for Ferrari at Modena after the Argentine Grand Prix, Alfonso de Portago was killed during the Milla Miglia race. 
      </p>
      <p>The Suez crisis affected the Dutch and Spanish Grand Prix which were cancelled.</p>
      <p>Juan Manuel Fangio retired from Formula 1 at the end of the season and the Maserati team pulled out of Formula 1 at the end of the season.</p>
      <p>Masten Gregory was the first American to score a Formula 1 podium finish when he finished on the podium at the Monaco Grand Prix and the Vanwall team scored their first Formula 1 podium. 
        It was Masten Gregory's Formula 1 debut, Tony Brooks also scored his first podium finish at the Monaco Grand Prix.
      </p>
      <p>Herbert Mackay-Fraser made his Formula 1 debut at the French Grand Prix, it was his only Formula 1 Grand Prix as he died a week later during a Formula 2 race at Reims.</p>
      <p>Stirling Moss and Tony Brooks won the British Grand Prix, it was the first win for Brooks and also the first Formula 1 win for the Vanwall team. 
        The Vanwall was the first British built car to win a Formula 1 Grand Prix.
      </p>
      <p>The organisers of the German Grand Prix opened the field to Formula 2 cars, they were not eligible for championship points, some of the Formula 2 entrants included Jack Brabham, Carel Godin de Beaufort and Roy Salvadori. 
        Juan Manuel Fangio clinched the championship after winning the German Grand Prix with two races to go, it was his 24th and last Formula 1 victory.
      </p>
      <p>The Pescara was the only Formula 1 race held at the circuit and it was the longest circuit to stage a Formula 1 race at 25.8km long. 
        The Pescara Grand Prix was the first of two consecutive races held in Italy, it was the first time two Formula 1 race were held in the same country in the same year. 
        The Grand Prix was held due to the sudden cancellation of the Belgian and Dutch Grand Prix. 
      </p>
      <p>The Pescara track was one of the most difficult and dangerous, Enzo Ferrari did not send the Ferrari team to the race, but Luigi Musso persuaded him to enter a single car. 
        Three months earlier 11 people had been killed during the Milli Miglia including Ferrari driver Alfonso de Portago. During the race Jack Brabham stopped at a roadside petrol station to tap up as he was running short of fuel and was far from the pits.
