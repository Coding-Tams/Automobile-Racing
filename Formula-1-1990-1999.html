    <!--1992 Season-->
    <h2>1992 Formula 1 Season</h2>
    <p>Nigel Mansell won the Championship and Williams won the constructors title.</p>
    <p>Nigel Mansell was the first driver to win nine races in a season, he was the first British driver to win the championship since James Hunt in 1976. The championship was won with five races to go.</p>
    <p>Michael Schumacher finished third in the championship in his first full season, Martin Brundle partnered Schumacher at Benetton.
      Female driver Giovanna Amati was signed by the Brabham team. The Coloni team had been renamed Andrea Moda Formula.
    </p>
    <p>The teams that were required to pre-qualify were the Larrousse team, a Fondmetal and a Footwork car and the Andrea Moda team. At the South African Grand Prix the Moda teamwere excluded so pre-qualifying was cancelled.
      Andrea Moda fashion company was owned by Andrea Sassetti who bought the Coloni team, it was ruled that Andrea Moda was a new team and not a continuation of the Coloni team, so the team had to pay $100,000 guarantee.
      Sassetti believed he did not have to pay the guarantee for the new teams as he believed to have purchased an existing team.
      Officials decided he had not purchased Coloni's entry into Formula 1 or the constructor itself, only its cars and facilities.
      Andrea Sassetti lodged an appeal citing the fact several other teams such as March, Fondmetal and Footwork had not been required to pay the guarantee when the teams changed hands. 
    </p>
    <p>Michael Schumacher scored his first Formula 1 podium at the Mexican Grand Prix, again pre-qualifying was cancelled due to the andrea Moda team cars not being ready in time.
      It was the last Mexican Grand Prix until 2015.
    </p>
    <p>Andrea Moda had fired drivers Alex Coffi and Enrico Bertaggio and signed Roberto Moreno and Perry McCarthy. McCarthy had hastily acquired a super licence but when he arrived at the circuit for the Brazilian Grand Prix the race director, Roland Bruynseraede told him there had been an error in the issuing of the licence, so McCarthy was withdrawn from the race.
      Ivan Capelli scored his first points as a Ferrari driver.
    </p>
    <p>At the Spanish Grand Prix Damon Hill made his Formula 1 debut with the Brabham team, he replaced Giovanna Amati who Brabham had dismissed.
      Perry McCarthy had managed to regain his super licence, but he failed to pre-qualify along with his team mate Roberto Moreno.
    </p>
    <p>At the San Marino Grand Prix Nigel Mansell became the first Formula 1 driver to win the first five races of the season.
      At the Monaco Grand Prix Roberto Moreno managed to qualify for the race, the only time the Andrea Moda team qualified for a race.
    </p>
    <p>The Andrea Moda team experienced more problems at the Canadian Grand Prix when the engines for the cars had been withheld by the freight forwarding agentfor non-payment of debts.
      The team had to borrow an engine from the Brabham team, it allowed Roberto Moreno to take part in pre-qualifying.
      The Ligier team scored their first Formula 1 points since 1989.
    </p>
    <p>The Andrea Moda team failed to arrive at the French Grand Prix as the teams transporter was stuck in traffic to to a blockade by French lorry drivers.
      All the other teams were affected by the blockade but only Andrea Moda failed to arrive meaning that pre-qualifying was not needed. Martin Brundle scored his first Formula 1 podium finish, it was the only the second time since 1981 that Alain Prost had not appeared on the podium at the French Grand Prix.
    </p>
    <p>The German Grand Prix was the last time Andrea Chiesa entered a Formula 1 race, he failed to qualify for the race.
      Perry McCarthy was excluded from the race due to missing a weightcheck.
    </p>
    <p>Nigel Mansell clinched the World Championship title at the Hungarian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Eric Van de Poele replaced Andrea Chiesa at Fondmetal, he managed to qualify for the race. Brabham reduced their entry to one car so Larrouse driver Bertrand Gachot no longer required to pre-qualify. 
      It was the last time in Formula 1 that pre-qualifying was held.
      Andrea Moda did not make a serious attempt to run their second car, Roberto Moreno used both cars to pre-qualify and Perry McCarthy was only allowed to leave the pits 45 seconds before the end of the session leaving no chance to reach the start-finish line to begin a timed lap before the chequered flag was waved.
      Andrea Moda Formula was warned to make proper efforts to run both cars at the Belgian Grand Prix or face suspension from the Italian Grand Prix.
      After the Hungarian Grand Prix the Brabham team withdrew from Formula 1.
    </p>
    <p>Damon Hill's first Formula 1 start came at the British Grand Prix, Michele Alboreto was replaced in the pre-qualifying pool by Gabriele Tarquini meaning both the Fondmetal drivers now were required to pre-qualify.</p>
    <p>Ferrari's 500th Formula 1 start came at the Belgian Grand Prix.</p>
    <p>Michael Schumacher won the Belgian Grand Prix, it was his first Formula 1 win and the first win for a German driver since Jochen Mass in 1975.
      Emanuele Naspetti made his Grand Prix debut replacing Paul Belmondo at March.
      It was the last race for Andrea Moda Formula team, Perry McCarthy crashed during qualifying and reported to the team he suspected that the steering rack was flexing and the steering was jammed.
      Team boss Andrea Sassetti replied that the team knew the rack was faulty, McCarthy quit the team. Andrea Sassetti was arrested in the paddock on the Saturday afternoon of the Belgian Grand Prix on allegations of forging documments and fraud.
      Erik Comas had a heavy crash during practice and was withdrawn from the race.
    </p>
    <p>The Andrea Moda Formula team had been excluded from Formula 1 for 'conduct prejucial to the sport', the team arrived at the Italian Grand Prix but were refused entry to the Monza circuit.
      Nigel Mansell announced his retirement from Formula 1, a few minutes before the press conference he was told he could partner Prost the next season, but Mansell still announced his retirement.
      Rumours were circulating that Williams had signed Alain Prost for the following season and were attempting to sign Ayrton Senna.
    </p>
    <p>Nigel Mansell won the Portuguese Grand Prix setting a new record for the most wins and points in a season with nine wins and 108 points.
      It was the first time since 1987 that there was no pre-qualifying and all the cars started the race. The Fondmetal team did not arrive at the Estoril circuit due to financial problems, the third race in succession a team exited Formula 1.
    </p>
    <p>Nicola Larini replaced Ivan Capelli at Ferrari, Karl Wendlinger left March to join Sauber, Jan Lammers made his first Formula 1 start for over 10 years.
    Christian Fittipaldi scored his first Formula 1 points at the Japanese Grand Prix and it was the only points of the season for Minardi.</p>
    <p>Jordan scored their only point of the season at the Australian Grand Prix, Thierry Boutsen scored his last points of his Formula 1 career.
      Benetton became the first team to score points in every round of the season since Lotus in 1963.
      It was the last race for Jan Lammers, Stefano Modena, Mauricio Gugelmin and Olivier Grouillard, also the last Formula 1 race for the March team.
    </p>
    <p>Drivers who failed to qualify during 1992 were Paul Belmondo, Andrea Chiesa, Stefano Modena, Giovanna Amati, Aguri Suzuki, Eric Van de Poele, Ukyo Katayama, Damon Hill
      Mika Hakkinen, Christian Fittipaldi, Alessandro Zanardi, JJ Lehto </p>
